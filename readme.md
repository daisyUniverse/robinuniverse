# Hi, welcome to my Github!

I'm robin! I'm a linux nerd who likes to tweak everything I mess with, so I have had my hand in a lot of different pots, like
[3D Art](https://sketchfab.com/Robin.Universe), [Web Development](https://hirob.in/), [Minecraft Server Modding](https://github.com/Luminoso-256/Cloth-Server/commits?author=robinuniverse), [Minecraft Resource Pack Creation](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/robinuniverse/), [a lot of linux homelab management](https://github.com/robinuniverse/scripts), [2D Art + Photography](https://www.deviantart.com/keybourd-man), 

If you've gotten any use out of any of my projects, you help me out by supporting me on ko-fi! (or just letting me know you're using my stuff, that also makes my day a lot better)
